/*!
 * @function dispatch_pthread_root_queue_create
 *
 * @abstract
 * Creates a new concurrent dispatch root queue with a pthread-based pool of
 * worker threads owned by the application.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Dispatch pthread root queues are similar to the global concurrent dispatch
 * queues in that they invoke blocks concurrently, however the blocks are not
 * executed on ordinary worker threads but use a dedicated pool of pthreads not
 * shared with the global queues or any other pthread root queues.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a special-purpose facility that should only be used in very
 * limited circumstances, in almost all cases the global concurrent queues
 * should be preferred. While this facility allows for more flexibility in
 * configuring worker threads for special needs it comes at the cost of
 * increased overall memory usage due to reduced thread sharing and higher
 * latency in worker thread bringup.
 *
 * Dispatch pthread root queues do not support suspension, application context
 * and change of width or of target queue. They can however be used as the
 * target queue for serial or concurrent queues obtained via
 * dispatch_queue_create() or dispatch_queue_create_with_target(), which
 * enables the blocks submitted to those queues to be processed on the root
 * queue's pthread pool.
 *
 * When a dispatch pthread root queue is no longer needed, it should be
 * released with dispatch_release(). Existing worker pthreads and pending blocks
 * submitted to the root queue will hold a reference to the queue so it will not
 * be deallocated until all blocks have finished and worker threads exited.
 *
 * @param label
 * A string label to attach to the queue.
 * This parameter is optional and may be NULL.
 *
 * @param flags
 * Pass flags value returned by dispatch_pthread_root_queue_flags_pool_size()
 * or 0 if unused.
 *
 * @param attr
 * Attributes passed to pthread_create(3) when creating worker pthreads. This
 * parameter is copied and can be destroyed after this call returns.
 * This parameter is optional and may be NULL.
 *
 * @param configure
 * Configuration block called on newly created worker pthreads before any blocks
 * for the root queue are executed. The block may configure the current thread
 * as needed.
 * This parameter is optional and may be NULL.
 *
 * @result
 * The newly created dispatch pthread root queue.
